- **Build Tool**: Vite for fast development and optimized production builds
- **UI Library**: Shadcn-ui components with Tailwind CSS
- **State Management**: React Context API + useReducer
- **PWA Features**: Service Workers, Web App Manifest
- **Offline Support**: IndexedDB for local data storage

### Backend (Recommended Architecture)
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **API Design**: RESTful APIs with OpenAPI 3.0 specification
- **Authentication**: JWT with refresh tokens
- **Validation**: Joi for input validation
- **ORM**: Prisma for database operations

### Database
- **Primary Database**: PostgreSQL for transactional data
- **Cache**: Redis for session management and real-time data
- **Search**: Elasticsearch for product search and analytics
- **File Storage**: AWS S3 or similar for document storage

### Infrastructure
- **Cloud Provider**: AWS/Azure/GCP
- **Containerization**: Docker + Kubernetes
- **Load Balancer**: NGINX or cloud load balancer
- **CDN**: CloudFlare or AWS CloudFront
- **Monitoring**: New Relic or DataDog
- **Logging**: ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)

## Security Architecture

### Authentication & Authorization
- Multi-factor authentication (SMS, Email, Biometric)
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- JWT tokens with 15-minute expiry
- Refresh token rotation

### Data Protection
- AES-256 encryption at rest
- TLS 1.3 for data in transit
- PCI DSS Level 1 compliance
- GDPR compliance for data privacy

### API Security
- OAuth 2.0 for third-party integrations
- Rate limiting (100 requests/minute per user)
- API key management for mobile money providers
- Request signing with HMAC-SHA256

## Performance Requirements
- **Response Time**: < 2 seconds for all API calls
- **Throughput**: 10,000 transactions per minute
- **Availability**: 99.9% uptime SLA
- **Scalability**: Auto-scaling based on load

## Compliance & Regulatory
- **PCI DSS**: Payment card industry compliance
- **AML/KYC**: Anti-money laundering and know your customer
- **Local Regulations**: Compliance with each country's financial regulations
- **Data Residency**: Country-specific data storage requirements

## Disaster Recovery
- **RTO**: 4 hours (Recovery Time Objective)
- **RPO**: 1 hour (Recovery Point Objective)
- **Backup**: Daily automated backups with 7-day retention
- **Failover**: Multi-region deployment with automatic failover

## Integration Patterns

### Mobile Money Provider Integration
```mermaid

    participant User
    participant NoblePay
    participant MobileMoneyAPI
    participant Provider
    
    User->>NoblePay: Initiate Top-up
    NoblePay->>NoblePay: Validate User & Amount
    NoblePay->>MobileMoneyAPI: Request Top-up
    MobileMoneyAPI->>Provider: Process Transaction
    Provider-->>MobileMoneyAPI: Transaction Status
    MobileMoneyAPI-->>NoblePay: Confirmation
    NoblePay-->>User: Success Notification
```

### Cross-Border Remittance Flow

    participant NoblePay
    participant ComplianceEngine
    participant BankingPartner
    participant Recipient
    
    Sender->>NoblePay: Send Money Request
    NoblePay->>ComplianceEngine: AML/KYC Check
    ComplianceEngine-->>NoblePay: Compliance Approved
    NoblePay->>BankingPartner: Execute Transfer
    BankingPartner-->>NoblePay: Transfer Confirmed
    NoblePay-->>Recipient: Funds Available
    NoblePay-->>Sender: Transaction Complete
```

## Deployment Architecture

### Production Environment
- **Load Balancer**: NGINX with SSL termination
- **Application Servers**: 3+ Node.js instances
- **Database**: PostgreSQL cluster with read replicas
- **Cache**: Redis cluster for high availability
- **Monitoring**: Real-time health checks and alerting

### Staging Environment

- Hot reload for rapid development
- Mock services for external APIs

## Next Steps for Implementation
1. **Phase 1**: Core infrastructure setup (Weeks 1-4)
2. **Phase 2**: User management and authentication (Weeks 5-8)
3. **Phase 3**: Payment services integration (Weeks 9-16)
4. **Phase 4**: Marketplace and advanced features (Weeks 17-24)
5. **Phase 5**: Multi-country rollout (Weeks 25-36)
